# Project-Euler-Solutions

## Description
This repository holds my solutions to the Project Euler problems which can be found [here](https://projecteuler.net/archives). These problems range from very easy to incredibly challenging.

## Purpose
Project Euler problems are a great way to test your programming, algorithm, and data structure skills. They are also a great way to test your critical thinking, mathematical ability, and to prepare for technical programming interviews.
