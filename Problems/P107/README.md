# P107 Minimal Network

## Description
This problem essentially ask's to perform Kruskal's algorithm on a given matrix of edges. I reused my implentation of Kruskal's algorithm which can be found [here](https://github.com/mikee649/ECE-250/tree/master/Lab4). P107.cpp simply reads the file and pipes the data to the existing implementation.
